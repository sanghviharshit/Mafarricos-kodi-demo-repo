# Lifx (Ambilight) Addon for Kodi

A [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) add-on that controls [Lifx](http://www.lifx.com/) lights. In `Theater mode` the add-on dims the Lifx lights as soon as a movie starts playing, and turns the lights back to original settings once the movie is done. `Ambilight mode` turns your Lifx lights in a room-sized **[Ambilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilight).**

>Ambilight creates light effects around the television that correspond to the video content. Philips claims that a "more immersive viewing experience" can result. Ambilight is a lighting system that actively adjusts both brightness and color based upon picture content. Integrated into the television cabinet, Ambilight technology is aimed to enable the viewer to see more picture detail, contrast and color while eliminating on-screen reflections.

>Ambilight technology works by projecting light from the rear of the TV cabinet in a very wide range of colors, shades and intensities. Viewers can choose to have Ambilight follow the color and brightness of the programme content â€“ automatically changing with the colors on the screen

## Installation

- Download the add-on as a ZIP file from the top of this page
  - (Right click on the "ZIP" icon and select "Download Linked File")
- Open Kodi
- Go to System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file
- Restart Kodi and configure the add-on:
- System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Enabled add-ons -> Services -> Lifx Ambilight
- Configure available settings.

## Settings for specific Use cases

**I have 3 (color/white) ceiling bulbs, 2 color bulbs behind the TV in my living room, and 4 more bulbs in my bedroom/bathroom. Would it be possible to set it up so that the 3 ceiling bulbs would dim (theater mode), use the 2 color lamps behind TV as ambilight, and don't use the 4 bulbs in bedroom/bathroom at all?**

  - From your lifx app
    1. Add the 3 ceiling bulbs to a separate group (e.g. theater)
    2. Add the 2 color lamps behind TV to a separate group (e.g. ambilight)
  - Now from addon settings
    1. In the main settings, select the mode as Ambilight mode and enable for group of lights instead of All lights and use the group name from previous steps (e.g. ambilight lamps).
    2. In the Ambilight settings - enable Dim before playback for group of lights and use appropriate group name (e.g. theater).

## Issues

**Raspberry Pi users:**
  - Save the add-on configuration by exiting Kodi before shutting down the Pi completely
Ambilight mode doesn't work on a Raspberry Pi due to the way it renders video

**ARM based devices/Nexus Player/Any other Android devices:**
  - Try disabling Mediacodec (Surface) in Settings > Video> Acceleration. This seems to fix the problem. [Reference](https://github.com/michaelrcarroll/script.kodi.hue.ambilight/issues/30)

**Other issues:**
  - Please use Github issue tracker for reporting new issues.
