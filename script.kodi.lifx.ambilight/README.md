# script.kodi.lifx.ambilight

A [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) add-on that controls [Lifx](http://www.lifx.com/) lights. In `Theater mode` the add-on dims the Lifx lights as soon as a movie starts playing, and turns the lights back to original settings once the movie is done. `Ambilight mode` turns your Lifx lights in a room-sized **[ambilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilight).**

>Ambilight creates light effects around the television that correspond to the video content. Philips claims that a "more immersive viewing experience" can result. Ambilight is a lighting system that actively adjusts both brightness and color based upon picture content. Integrated into the television cabinet, Ambilight technology is aimed to enable the viewer to see more picture detail, contrast and color while eliminating on-screen reflections.

>Ambilight technology works by projecting light from the rear of the TV cabinet in a very wide range of colors, shades and intensities. Viewers can choose to have Ambilight follow the color and brightness of the programme content â€“ automatically changing with the colors on the screen

## Issues

**Raspberry Pi users:**
  - Save the add-on configuration by exiting Kodi before shutting down the Pi completely
Ambilight mode doesn't work on a Raspberry Pi due to the way it renders video

**ARM based devices/Nexus Player/Any other Android devices:**
  - Try disabling Mediacodec (Surface) in Settings > Video> Acceleration. This seems to fix the problem. [Reference](https://github.com/michaelrcarroll/script.kodi.hue.ambilight/issues/30)

  - Please use github issue tracker for reporting new issues.
